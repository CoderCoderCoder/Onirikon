# Onirikon

Onirikon is a puzzle game where you take control a Frenchman stumbling through the streets of Chania. Eating cheese will increase your weight, while drinking a healthy glass of wine will reduce your weight. In order to pass certain areas you'll need to be either thin (narrow corridors) or big (tornado). If you find the exit, you win.

A genetic algorithm evolves the levels to produce progressivly harder levels. The fitness function optimizes for levels that require more A* search optimizations to find the shortest path.
